After a long time thinking if I should do this or not, I finally decided to start my blog. I'll try to keep it updated with new content but right now I can't give you a schedule for the posts but I plan to have one in soon.

Talking about the blog, I wanted to have a very simple and basic set of features and wanted to have full control of it. After trying different tools I decided to use Jekyll which is a static site generator (there are other alternatives but this one is simple enough) and the posts are edited using Markdown which is very easy to do and you can even use a simple text editor for it if you are familiar with the syntax.

Anyway, there's plenty for me to do here. I hope I can give something useful or interesting but I can't promise it will always be the case. This is the beginning so let's see how it goes.

Welcome!
