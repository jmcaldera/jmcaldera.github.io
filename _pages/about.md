Hi! I'm José Caldera, and I'm an Android Developer.

I've been working in Android for the last 4 years now. I taught myself how to program in Android and I was lucky enough to have an opportunity to try it out at one of my previous jobs where I was working as an Electronics Engineer. From there my career as a Developer took off and I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far. Currently working @NisumChile.

When I'm not doing any job related tasks, I'm my free time I like to learn new stuffs related to software development, specially those that are related to Android and new technologies that are always coming out. Also I'm a fan of baking so maybe I'll share some receipts over here.

My intention with this blog is to share useful content or at least something valuable that you can take advantage of. Hopefully something to avoid others some troubles while solving some problem or maybe just something new and fun.

Questions? Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jmcaldera).
